# 🐍 Python Advanced – Phase 1 of My AI/ML Roadmap  

This repository marks **Phase 1** of my Advanced AI/ML Roadmap, where I strengthen Python foundations beyond the basics — diving into **databases, networking, web services, and intermediate Python concepts**. These skills are essential for building scalable, data-driven AI/ML applications.  

It’s not just about syntax — it’s about practical, production-ready programming skills that power intelligent systems.

## 📂 Repository Structure  

### 1. Databases  
- **SQLite Integration** – Creating, querying, and managing relational databases.  
- **Roster Management** – Handling structured datasets in `.json` and `.sqlite`.  
- **Email Database Handling** – Parsing, storing, and analyzing email datasets.  
- **Music & Fun Databases** – Working with `.db` files for small-scale projects.  

### 2. Networked Programming  
- **Socket Programming** – Low-level networking with custom protocols.  
- **Web Scraping** – Parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup (bs4).  
- **URL Handling** – Using urllib to fetch and process online resources.  

### 3. Web Services  
- **JSON Handling** – Parsing, serializing, and consuming RESTful API data.  
- **XML Processing** – Extracting and structuring XML data for downstream use.  

### 4. Intermediate Python  
- **Core Topics** – Collections, Itertools, Generators, Decorators, Lambda, Asterisk, Exceptions, etc.  
- **Logging System** – Basic logging, config-driven logging, RotatingFileHandler & TimedRotatingFileHandler.

## 🔧 Tech Stack  
- **Python 3** (advanced concepts & libraries)  
- **SQLite** (lightweight relational database)  
- **BeautifulSoup (bs4)** (HTML parsing)  
- **Sockets & urllib** (network communication)  
- **JSON/XML** (data serialization formats)

## 🎯 Why This Phase Matters  
This phase ensures I can:  
- Store & retrieve datasets efficiently.  
- Communicate across networks and interact with APIs.  
- Apply intermediate Python features for robust software development.  
- Bridge data pipelines between raw web data and AI-ready formats.
