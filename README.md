🐍 Python Advanced – Phase 1 of My AI/ML Roadmap

This repository marks Phase 1 of my Advanced AI/ML Roadmap, where I strengthen my Python foundations beyond the basics — diving into databases, networking, and web services — all essential for building scalable, data-driven AI/ML applications.

It’s not just about syntax — it’s about practical, production-ready programming skills that power intelligent systems.

📂 Structure
1. Databases

Building the bridge between Python and persistent data storage.

SQLite Integration – Creating, querying, and managing relational databases.

Roster Management – Handling structured datasets in .json and .sqlite.

Email Database Handling – Parsing, storing, and analyzing email datasets.

Music & Fun Databases – Working with .db files for small-scale projects.

2. Networked Programming

Mastering how Python communicates across systems and the web.

Socket Programming – Low-level networking with custom protocols.

Web Scraping – Parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup (bs4) for structured data extraction.

URL Handling – Using urllib to fetch and process online resources.

3. Web Services

Interacting with APIs and structured web data formats.

JSON Handling – Parsing, serializing, and consuming RESTful API data.

XML Processing – Extracting and structuring XML data for downstream use.

🔧 Tech Stack

Python 3 (Advanced concepts & libraries)

SQLite (Lightweight relational database)

BeautifulSoup (bs4) (HTML parsing)

Sockets & urllib (Networking)

JSON/XML (Data serialization formats)

🎯 Why This Phase Matters

This phase ensures I can:

Store & retrieve large datasets efficiently.

Communicate across networks and interact with APIs.

Bridge data pipelines between raw web data and AI-ready formats.

📅 Status

Phase 1 – Ongoing (More advanced modules coming soon as per the AI/ML roadmap)
